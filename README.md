### Problem

Current credit system in India has two main problems:

- Unorganised credit distribution
  - Asset bases credit solutions
  - More favourable to rich people
  - High interest rates
- Numerous LSPs(Loan Service Providers)
  - Customer has to go through lot of LSPs to find best offer
  - Plethora of paperwork
  - Overall process can even take days to finalise loans.

### Why now?

- Sep, 2021: RBI released [Account Aggregator framework](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/account-aggregator-concept-can-be-the-next-upi-in-india-adhil-shetty-of-bankbazaar-348088-2022-09-24#:~:text=Account) to promote easy credit systems in India
